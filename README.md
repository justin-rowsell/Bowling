# Overview
Blazor .NET app with the basic functionality to log the scores from the rounds of a bowling match and calculate the scores.

## How to run
Clone the repo and run the dontent run or dotnet watch command to run the app locally (The dafault port is 5049).

## Considerations for future releases
1. Add front end validation to dynamically prevent users from entering more than 10 points for a given round.
2. Dynamically calculate scores as rounds are being entered.
